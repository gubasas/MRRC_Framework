# MRRC Framework Docs

This folder collects theory notes and runnable walkthroughs.

Contents:
- Alpha variation overview and expected signals
- Data ingestion guidance (replace simulated CSVs with real catalogs)
- Notebook: run α variation analysis end-to-end

Provenance:
- Quasar: SDSS/VLT/Keck α-variation catalogs (Webb et al.)
- Atomic clocks: NIST/PTB constraints (Al+/Hg+, Yb/Sr)
