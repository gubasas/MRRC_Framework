# Interaction Spawning Analysis - December 5, 2025

## Overview

This folder contains computational analysis of MRRC universe evolution focusing on:
1. **Interaction-driven particle creation** (98% of spawns from MRRC-MRRC interactions)
2. **4D spacetime symmetry emergence** (3-sphere × line geometry like our universe)
3. **Mass cluster formation** from information cost minimization
4. **Spontaneous symmetry breaking** (71% asymmetric configurations)

## Files

### Simulations
- `mrrc_interaction_analysis.py` - Fast non-GUI analysis with mass & symmetry tracking
- `mrrc_enhanced_universe.py` - Real-time visualization with 4D symmetry panel (may crash on older hardware)

### Documentation
- `ONTOLOGY.md` - Complete philosophical and technical framework
- `README.md` - This file

## Key Results

### Interaction Spawning (10 TeV simulation)
```
Total MRRCs: 1500
Vacuum fluctuations: 27 (1.8%)
Interaction spawns: 1473 (98.2%)
Decoherence: T = 5.8
Speed of light: c = 25.7 (emerged)
```

### 4D Symmetries Observed
```
Asymmetric: 71.4% (symmetry breaking)
3-sphere × line: 14.3% (our universe's geometry!)
2-sphere: 14.3% (rotational)
```

### Mass Formation
```
Clusters: 2 major
Largest: 1493 MRRCs → 1.13 keV/c²
Energy used: 0.0075% of 10 TeV
```

## Running Simulations

### Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Fast Analysis (Recommended)
```bash
python3 mrrc_interaction_analysis.py
```
**Output:** Detailed spawning statistics, mass clusters, 4D symmetries  
**Runtime:** ~10 seconds  
**Memory:** Low (no visualization)

### Real-time Visualization (Advanced)
```bash
python3 mrrc_enhanced_universe.py
```
**Warning:** May crash on systems with limited resources. Close window to stop and analyze.

## Key Insights

1. **Particles create particles** - 98% from interactions, not vacuum
2. **Symmetry breaks naturally** - 71% asymmetric despite F4 foundation
3. **Our geometry emerges** - 3-sphere × line observed 14% of time
4. **One rule explains all** - Minimize information cost → everything else

## Connection to 24-Cell Work

The 24-cell polytope (F4 symmetry) represents the **mathematical foundation** of the 4-tuple state space.

These simulations show how that **perfect symmetry spontaneously breaks** during evolution:
- Start: Perfect 24-cell symmetry (potential)
- Evolution: Information cost minimization
- Result: 71% broken symmetry + mass hierarchy

**This is exactly like:**
- Electroweak symmetry breaking → separate EM & weak forces
- Chiral symmetry breaking → hadron masses
- Perfect symmetry → physical realization → observable universe

**The 24-cell paper remains valid** - it describes the underlying mathematical structure that these simulations dynamically break.
