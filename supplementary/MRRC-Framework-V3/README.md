# MRRC-Framework-V3

**V3.0** (2023–2024) of the Minimal Recorded Relational Change (MRRC) framework as a constraint-logic model for analyzing information processing in systems capable of sustained, ordered evolution. MRRC identifies the minimal structural requirements for detecting, encoding, and persisting differences between states in a way that influences future evolution.

## Continuation

This repository has been integrated into the **[MRRC_Framework](https://github.com/gubasas/MRRC_Framework)** repository (V5.1+) as `supplementary/MRRC-Framework-V3/`.

For current empirical validation, α-variation tests, simulations, and ongoing development, see:
- **Main repository**: [gubasas/MRRC_Framework](https://github.com/gubasas/MRRC_Framework)
- **Papers**: Top-level `V3.pdf`, `V4.pdf` promoted from this archive
- **Version timeline**: V3 → V4 → V5.0 → V5.1 (mode-locked accounting, empirical tests)

This archive preserves the foundational theoretical work and Kosmos simulation reports (RUN2–RUN4).
