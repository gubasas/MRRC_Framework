# MRRC-Framework-V3
(V3.0) of the Minimal Recorded  Relational Change (MRRC) framework as a constraint-logic model for analyzing  information processing in systems capable of sustained, ordered evolution.  MRRC identifies the minimal structural requirements for detecting, encoding,  and persisting differences between states in a way that influences future  evolution.
