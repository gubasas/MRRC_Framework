### Kosmos Run 2: [Brief Description]
**File:** `Kosmos_Run2.pdf`

**Purpose:** 
Research Objective
Research Objective: Autonomously explore and refine the Minimal Recorded Relational Change
(MRRC) framework as a scientifically grounded cosmological model and underlying principle of
knowing. Iteratively validate and extend Theorem 4.3’s generating hypotheses on how MRRC’s
primitive constraints (PC1-5) and operations (unified information differences as distinctions across
spatial, temporal, or qualitative parameters) could map to cosmic evolution (e.g., entropy gradients
in expanding universes) and epistemic processes (e.g., information acquisition bounded by quantum
limits like Heisenberg’s uncertainty). Produce testable predictions on unified dual-constraints in
cosmological observables and epistemic models, focusing on regime transitions where thermo limits
dominate substrate specifics. 

**Key Findings:** 
Summary of Discoveries
Discovery 1: Open-system reformulation of MRRC primitives for irreversible
dynamics and epistemic bounds
This work recasts MRRC’s primitive axioms into an explicitly open‑system, irreversible formu-
lation by replacing substrate‑level reversibility with task‑reversibility and an explicit, bounded
waste‑information substrate, tying maintenance of correlations to resource flows and entropy export.
The reformulated framework quantitatively matches complexity saturation in engineered substrates,
fails under a naïve cosmological mapping, and is then repaired by adding a horizon‑thermodynamic
resource term and a finite capacity ceiling, yielding testable dual‑constraint predictions for cosmology
and epistemic processes.
Discovery 2: Substrate-dependent saturation and rollback costs under MRRC
Theorems 4.1-4.3
Across networks, cellular automata, and quantum substrates, MRRC’s maintenance (4.1), rollback
(4.2), and saturation (4.3) theorems delineate energetic and informational costs that control complexity
growth and state reconstruction. Linear rollback costs hold only in low-noise, non‑chaotic regimes,
while chaotic substrates collapse the linear window; complexity saturates at the minimum of
resource‑determined and substrate‑intrinsic ceilings. Metric choice is decisive in quantum tests, where
true entanglement measures recover the predicted resource–degradation tradeoff.
Discovery 3: Cosmological MRRC: failure of static saturation and success of
multiplicative growth with time-varying degradation
This work shows that a static, saturation-based reading of MRRC Theorem 4.3 catastrophically fails
for cosmology, but that a multiplicative growth law coupled to a physically motivated, time-varying
degradation rate β(t) reproduces multi‑era, sub‑linear power‑law growth. The resulting dynamics
exhibit regime switching and hysteresis under dual, time‑varying limits, revealing non‑equilibrium
memory that is quantitatively predictive.
Discovery 4: Quantum error correction as an MRRC testbed: thresholds, super-
linear certainty costs, and optimal adaptive control
Quantum error correction (QEC) provides a clean, controllable testbed for the Minimal Recorded
Relational Change (MRRC) framework: maintaining logical correlations requires trading continuous
resource input against degradation, and a threshold in the resource-to-degradation ratio marks a
saturation boundary as predicted by MRRC’s complexity ceiling. Beyond this threshold, pushing
fidelity higher carries a super-linear “cost of certainty” that depends on code structure, and adaptive—
especially preventive—control policies measurably raise the maintainable fidelity at fixed budget.

### Kosmos Run 3: [actionable
instructions for the next Kosmos run that comprehensively addresses all concerns identified in my
analysis of the MRRC RUN2 report while expanding research on the Complexity Emergence Hierarchy
from MRRCV2.]
**File:** `Kosmos_Run3.pdf`

**Purpose:** [Describe what this run tests, e.g., "Applies MRRC hierarchical 
architecture to brain imaging datasets to test tier-dependent dynamics"]

**Key Findings:** [Discovery 1: Validated Statistical Corrections and Reproducibility Baseline for
MRRC RUN2
This work validates and corrects the statistical record of MRRC RUN2 and establishes a reproducibility
baseline. Manual re-extraction and re-analysis confirm effect sizes for 100% of tests, resolve p-value
artifacts introduced by PDF formatting, standardize reporting across trajectories, and correct an
overclaimed near-perfect correlation to a strong but imperfect association. After Benjamini–Hochberg
correction across 12 parseable tests, 11 remain significant and one (r38) does not.
Discovery 2: Cross-Level Scaling Laws and Emergence Metrics in the MRRC
Hierarchy
Cross-level synthesis of MRRC trajectories shows that scaling behavior and temporal dynamics are
hierarchical-level dependent. Cosmological systems are trend-dominated and regime-switching, while
oscillatory regimes arise primarily in computational settings; moreover, a pilot power-law test near a
putative critical point found no significant scaling, underscoring limits on universality. Completion
of effect-size reporting and FDR-adjusted inference enables robust, publication-grade cross-level
comparisons.
Discovery 3: Quantized Attractor States and Dynamic Stiffness in Cosmological-
Level MRRC Systems
Two cosmological-scale trajectories share a common quantum of organization, q = 0.001, but express
it in different modes: r57 displays discrete, highly stable plateaus at integer multiples of q, whereas r52
shows quantization only in regime means despite continuously fluctuating states. A 29.4-fold difference
in a “dynamic stiffness” metric predicts this dichotomy, and the r57 multipliers show no non-trivial
number-theoretic structure, pointing to emergent dynamics rather than arithmetic constraints.
Discovery 4: Constraint-Functional Form-Measurement Architecture Triad Gov-
erns Effect-Size Heterogeneity
Across MRRC trajectories, effect sizes vary by more than two orders of magnitude, and this
heterogeneity is most coherently explained by a triad: the primitive constraints that delimit system
behavior, the functional forms those constraints select, and the measurement architecture used to
coarse-grain and estimate effects. Random-effects synthesis, failed interaction meta-regression, and
mechanistic case studies collectively indicate that hierarchical level alone is insuﬀicient to account for
effect-size dispersion, whereas aligning functional form with appropriate measurement choices resolves
otherwise contradictory results.]

Background: MRRCV2.pdf is unpublished paper by independent researcher, Run2 and Run3 are
consecutive Kosmos runs. Run 3 started with wrong parameters initially not considering the findings
of Run 2.]

**Key Findings:** [Discovery 1: Two-tier hierarchical architecture and tier-dependent hub-and-spoke
attractor dynamics in MRRCV3
MRRCV3 reveals a two-tier hierarchy with distinct attractor fingerprints: a mesoscale “sticky hub”
that is highly occupied and self-persistent, and a macroscale “transient hub” that is low-occupancy
and non-self-sustaining, yet both share a universal 100% return-to-hub property. A variability-
normalized metric fully separates the tiers, and cross-level analyses show that dynamic diversity
increases monotonically across the hierarchy, with dispersion mechanistically driven by mixing discrete
structural constants with continuous dynamical metrics.
Discovery 2: Fibonacci-governed quantization and mode-locked temporal organi-
zation unify MRRC constraints
MRRCV3 identifies a universal temporal base period of 5 index units that mode-locks inter-changepoint
intervals across quantum, control, and cosmological trajectories, while key system properties quantize
to small rational fractions. Scaling exponents and dynamic stiffness exhibit complementary but distinct
fraction families, linked by an intra-level meta-constraint, and a multiplicative coupling between timing
and exponent changes is rejected. A compact Fibonacci-based arithmetic, together with mode-locking
and discrete-scale-invariant dynamics, generates the observed integers and fractions coherently.
Discovery 3: Empirical constraints and model-specificity: non-universal scaling and
interpretation of q in MRRCV3
Cross-domain analyses of cosmological and genomic datasets show robust but non-universal power-
law scaling, directly contradicting any claim of exponent universality. Multiple internal and external
tests further demonstrate that the MRRC calibration q = 0.001 is not linked to observed exponents
or known universal constants, while MRRC trajectories themselves exhibit a hub-centric attractor
architecture with empirical analogues in neuroscience.]
